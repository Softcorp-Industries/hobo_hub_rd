<p>
I walked away from society many years ago. I'm the guy you see with the backpack and hoodie pulled up. We haven't talked or understood each other for a long time. So why I'm writing a blog now is just as baffling to me as it is to you. 
</p>
<p>
I guess we should start with an introduction, my name is Freight Train Freddie.
</p>
<p>
5 years ago I found myself in a very unfortunate position in life. I had a big financial set back and legal issuies which led to a homeless situation. I had no idea where to go for shelter, where I could get a hot meal or where I could shower and clean up. Would you know if you had to survive tomorrow on the street?
</p>
<p>
I struggled with depression for most of my life so being homeless didn't help any. I didn't know where get some of my basic needs met, which in turn caused more depression. This lead to a neverending cycle of basic survival mode which I stayed in for a couple of years. This wasn't because I didn't ask for help, I didn't know where to ask for help.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of people in this city willing to help. The problem was I didn't know the names of the places, where they where or what they offered. Over time I started to learn where I could go for certain things. This took a very long time.
</p>
<p>
When the Pandemic started in early 2020 I was homeless. I did however mange to get into an apartment shortly after the world shut down. This was where I did a lot of reflextion on my life and looked at a direction I thought I needed to go. I started to learn web development online. I learned HTML, CSS and javaScript from free web development tutorial sites, youTube Videos and building my own static web sites.
</p>

<br>

<p>
A common saying I found while I was learning was that you "solve problems with code".
</p>

<br>

<p>
I had a real world problem that I was fumbling my way through. The problem was who, what, where and how in an unkown world. I'm hoping to help solve that problem with a Blog site called The HOBO HUB. I hope the site can save someone a lot of time in their life by connecting them with services they need in the unkown world they're now in. I put together 6 different Blog pages in area's I felt important. They're used to connect the homeless and low-income with the right people or organizations for their individual needs and concerns.
</p>
<p>
The HOBO HUB has three top concerns for the homeless and low-income, they are Food, Clothing and Shelter. The HOBO HUB also has three underlying area's of concern which usually in my opinion lead to homelessness, stressfull life situations and or Mental Health issuies, they are Legal issues, Health concerns and or Income security.
</p>

<br>

<p>
I built things in construction for 30 years.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Now I build things on the Web.
</p>

<br>

<p>
This is what I built...
